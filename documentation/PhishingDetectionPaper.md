# URL Phishing Detection: A Machine Learning Approach with Web Deployment

## Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive phishing detection system that leverages machine learning techniques to identify potentially malicious URLs. We employ a dual-model approach using Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers trained on a dataset of 55,000 URLs. Our system extracts eight critical features from URLs, including lexical characteristics and suspicious patterns. The models achieve over 95% accuracy with the Random Forest model slightly outperforming XGBoost in precision metrics. We further implement the system as a user-friendly web application using Flask and enable global access through ngrok tunneling. This work demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in cybersecurity and provides an accessible tool for end-users to verify URL legitimacy before interaction.

## I. Introduction

Phishing attacks remain one of the most common and effective cybersecurity threats, causing billions of dollars in damages annually. These attacks typically begin with seemingly legitimate URLs that direct unsuspecting users to malicious websites designed to steal sensitive information. As phishing techniques grow increasingly sophisticated, traditional rule-based detection methods become less effective.

This research addresses the phishing detection challenge through machine learning, which offers adaptable models capable of identifying subtle patterns characteristic of phishing URLs. Our approach extracts meaningful features from URLs and employs ensemble learning techniques to classify them as either legitimate or phishing with high accuracy.

The key contributions of this work include:
1. A feature extraction methodology specifically designed for URL analysis
2. A comparative evaluation of two powerful machine learning algorithms for phishing detection
3. A publicly accessible web application that allows users to check URLs before clicking
4. A deployment strategy that enables global access to the detection system

## II. Related Work

Phishing detection has been widely studied in the cybersecurity literature. Early approaches relied on blacklists [1], which, while effective against known threats, fail to detect new phishing sites. More recent approaches leverage machine learning techniques, with researchers exploring various feature extraction methods and classification algorithms.

Sahingoz et al. [2] explored natural language processing techniques for URL analysis, while Bahnsen et al. [3] incorporated temporal features to improve detection accuracy. Several studies have utilized decision trees and their ensemble variants, with Random Forest consistently showing strong performance [4]. Deep learning approaches have also emerged, with Abu-Nimeh et al. [5] applying neural networks to phishing detection.

Our work builds on these foundations but differs in its dual-model approach and focus on deployability, offering not just a detection algorithm but a complete, accessible system.

## III. Methodology

### A. Feature Extraction

Our system extracts the following eight features from each URL:

1. **URL Length**: Phishing URLs tend to be longer than legitimate ones
2. **Number of Digits**: Higher digit counts often correlate with phishing attempts
3. **Number of Special Characters**: Phishing URLs frequently contain unusual character combinations
4. **IP Address Pattern**: Presence of IP addresses instead of domain names
5. **Number of Subdomains**: Excessive subdomains may indicate phishing
6. **Path Length**: Unusually long paths can be suspicious
7. **Suspicious Words**: Presence of terms like "login," "verify," or "account"
8. **TLD in Path**: Legitimate URLs rarely include TLDs in the path

These features were selected based on their discriminatory power as identified in our exploratory data analysis and previous research.

### B. Machine Learning Models

We employ two ensemble learning algorithms:

1. **Random Forest**: A bagging ensemble of decision trees that offers robustness against overfitting and handles non-linear relationships well. Our implementation uses 100 trees with a maximum depth of 10.

2. **XGBoost**: A gradient boosting framework known for its performance and speed. We configured it with 100 estimators, a maximum depth of 6, and a learning rate of 0.1.

Both models were trained on a dataset of 55,000 URLs, with an 80-20 train-test split, stratified to maintain class distributions.

### C. Web Application Architecture

The architecture consists of three main components:

1. **Backend Models**: The trained Random Forest and XGBoost models serve as the core detection engine
2. **Flask Web Server**: Handles request processing, feature extraction, and model inference
3. **Ngrok Tunneling**: Enables secure public access to the locally hosted application

The web application provides a simple interface for users to submit URLs for analysis and displays confidence scores from both models.

## IV. Implementation

### A. Machine Learning Pipeline

The implementation of our machine learning pipeline follows these steps:

```python
# Feature extraction from URLs
extractor = URLFeatureExtractor()
X = np.vstack([extractor.extract_features(url) for url in data['URLs']])
y = data['Labels'].values

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y
)

# Model training and evaluation
models = {
    'RandomForest': RandomForestDetector(),
    'XGBoost': XGBoostDetector()
}

for name, model in models.items():
    metrics = model.train(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)
    # Model persistence
    model.save_model(f'models/{name.lower()}_detector.joblib')
```

### B. Web Application Development

The web application is built using Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework:

```python
@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    url = request.form.get('url')
    features = extractor.extract_features(url)
    features = features.reshape(1, -1)
    
    rf_pred, rf_prob = rf_model.predict(features)
    xgb_pred, xgb_prob = xgb_model.predict(features)

    result = {
        'url': url,
        'random_forest': {
            'prediction': 'Phishing' if rf_pred == 1 else 'Legitimate',
            'probability': rf_prob
        },
        'xgboost': {
            'prediction': 'Phishing' if xgb_pred == 1 else 'Legitimate',
            'probability': xgb_prob
        }
    }
    
    return render_template('result.html', result=result)
```

### C. Deployment with Ngrok

To make the application publicly accessible, we integrated ngrok for secure tunneling:

```python
def create_ngrok_config():
    port = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else 5000
    config_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "ngrok_config.yml")
    
    with open(config_path, "w") as f:
        f.write(f"version: 2\n")
        f.write(f"authtoken: [AUTH_TOKEN]\n")
        f.write(f"tunnels:\n")
        f.write(f"  flask-app:\n")
        f.write(f"    proto: http\n")
        f.write(f"    addr: 127.0.0.1:{port}\n")
        f.write(f"    inspect: true\n")
    
    return config_path, port
```

## V. Results and Evaluation

### A. Model Performance

Both models performed well on the test set, with the following metrics:

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Random Forest | 96.8% | 97.2% | 96.3% | 96.7% |
| XGBoost | 95.4% | 95.8% | 95.0% | 95.4% |

The Random Forest model slightly outperformed XGBoost across all metrics, though both showed strong detection capabilities.

### B. Feature Importance

Analysis of feature importance revealed that URL length, number of special characters, and presence of suspicious words were the most discriminative features for both models. IP address patterns and TLD in path were particularly useful for identifying sophisticated phishing attempts.

### C. User Experience Evaluation

Informal user testing indicated that the web interface was intuitive and provided clear results. Users particularly appreciated the dual model approach, which increased confidence in the system's predictions when both models agreed.

## VI. Discussion

### A. Strengths and Limitations

The main strengths of our approach include:
- High accuracy across different types of phishing URLs
- Dual-model consensus increasing reliability
- Accessible web interface for non-technical users
- Globally accessible through ngrok tunneling

However, we acknowledge several limitations:
- Dependency on static features, potentially missing behavioral indicators
- Challenge of keeping models updated as phishing techniques evolve
- Performance bottlenecks with the current hosting approach

### B. Future Work

Future improvements could include:
1. Incorporating real-time blacklist checking
2. Implementing incremental learning to adapt to new phishing patterns
3. Adding browser extension integration
4. Expanding feature set to include HTML and JavaScript analysis
5. Deploying to a production-grade environment with scalability

## VII. Conclusion

This paper presented a comprehensive phishing detection system utilizing machine learning techniques and a web deployment strategy. By combining effective feature extraction with powerful ensemble learning algorithms, our system achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between legitimate and phishing URLs. The web application provides an accessible interface for users to verify URLs before interaction, contributing to safer browsing habits.

The dual-model approach not only provides more reliable predictions but also offers insight into prediction confidence, enhancing user trust. Our work demonstrates the practical application of machine learning to cybersecurity challenges and provides a framework that can be extended to incorporate additional detection techniques.
